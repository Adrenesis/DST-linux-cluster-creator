# DST-linux-cluster-creator
Allows you to create a cluster for dont starve together very fast and very easily !

It is very easy to use. Open this script and find this line (around line 370) : "	cd ~/.klei/DoNotStarveTogether/ # << line you have to edit to be in the right folder". Edit it to find your /.klei/DoNotStarveTogether/ directory.

Then launch it and you will be prompted to create a cluster. On the first screen you will be prompted to edit a cluster, this part is still to do and works with the "screen" package.

This script still does not support iptables but it's still a feature that will come later.
