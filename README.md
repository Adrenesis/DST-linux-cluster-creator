# DST-linux-cluster-creator
Allow you to create a cluster for dont starve together very fast and very easily!

# How to use it:
1. Open this script with your favorite text editor and find this line (around line 370): `cd ~/.klei/DoNotStarveTogether/ # << line you have to edit to be in the right folder`

2. Edit it to find your `/.klei/DoNotStarveTogether/` directory.

3. Then launch it and you will be prompted to create a cluster. 

# Miscelaneous:
On the first screen you will be prompted to ***create*** or ***edit*** a cluster. ***Edition*** is still a work in progress and will be available with the "screen" package, in 1.0 version.

This script still ***does not*** support ***iptables*** but it's a feature that will come later.
