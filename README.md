# DST-linux-cluster-creator
Allows you to create a cluster for dont starve together very fast and very easily !

How to use it:
It is very easy to use. 
1. Open this script with your favorite text editor and find this line (around line 370) : "	cd ~/.klei/DoNotStarveTogether/ # << line you have to edit to be in the right folder". 
2. Edit it to find your /.klei/DoNotStarveTogether/ directory.
3. Then launch it and you will be prompted to create a cluster. 

On the first screen you will be prompted to create or edit a cluster, this last part is still to do and will work with the "screen" package.

This script still does not support iptables but it's still a feature that will come later.
